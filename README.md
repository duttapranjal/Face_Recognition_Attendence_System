This is a web-based Face Recognition Attendance System that uses a webcam to detect and recognize faces in real-time. Built with Flask, OpenCV, and face_recognition, the system allows users to mark their attendance through a simple web interface. Recognized faces are logged into a CSV file along with the date and time, making attendance tracking efficient and contactless.
